## Course Title
Humanities Research Data Management

## Course Number
DSCI 350 / LIB 350

## Course Description
This course provides students with theoretical and practical experience in collecting, processing, archiving, and publishing humanities data (images, video, sound, text, maps, etc.) gathered from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs). With the goal of building thematic digital collections as researchers, students will learn digital methodologies focusing on the technical, legal, ethical, and social aspects of working with humanities research data throughout its curation lifecycle. This includes hands-on experience finding, assessing, organizing, and reformatting data; creating and remediating descriptive metadata; evaluating and determining copyright and licensing; writing a data management plan using the standards set by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and sharing thematic research digital collections using GitHub and the open-source platform CollectionBuilder.

## Instructor
Kate Thornhill, [kmthorn@uoregon.edu](kmthorn@uoregon.edu)

## Course Learning Outcomes
In this course, you will learn how to…
- Apply introductory digital stewardship (digital curation and preservation) actions to digital collections used as research data
- Solve issues around collecting, citing, standardizing, structuring, archiving, and publishing GLAM objects using information science best practices and guidelines
- Design and implement a humanities-based research data management plan for thematic research digital collection
- Develop communication skills with a team of people who have specific development roles and responsibilities associated with a technology project
- Use technical platforms and tools that making a digital collection publicly available online

## Course Acquired Skills
In this course, you will acquire the ability to...
- Create and follow a digital collections data management plan
- Apply information professional best practices and standards to digital files and metadata for findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility
- Structure metadata using spreadsheets and making them interoperable
- Evaluate GLAM objects using best judgements about United States copyright, fair use, and Creative Commons
- Find and select research materials to reuse within a thematic digital collection
- Publish a website using GitHub Pages and the Jekyll theme, CollectionBuilder

## Estimate Student Workload
This course has students working in groups to complete a term-long project. All requirements for this group project are scaffolded throughout the 10-week course. This means that all lab activities and assignments are designed bring you to publishing a thematic research digital collection using GitHub and CollectionBuilder, an open-source Jekyll static site generator specifically designed to present digital collections and digital exhibits online.

[More information about the final project and graded assignments can be found on the Term-Project page](/content/termproject.html).

*Each student will:*  

- Read assigned required readings identified in the syllabus. This includes book chapters, journal articles, technology tutorials, and audio-visual materials. All required readings are available on Canvas or through the UO Libraries in print or electronic format.

- Attend all lectures and labs, and participate in in-class activities because they support developing your term-based group project.

- Submit all individual assignments: Mid-term self-evaluation and reflection; Mid-term group evaluation and reflection; Final self-evaluation and reflection; Final group-evaluation and reflection  

- Submit group assignments: Mid-term project progress report; Data management plan and data documentation and dataset; Final project presentation

### For Purchase or Subscription
Everything in the class is FREE either as an open-source tool or available through the university because of your tuition dollars. This includes all readings and archival materials used to build your thematic research digital collection.

#### Tools and Platforms

The list below identifies tools and platforms that are required for class. Sometime to note: We are going to be using Microsoft 365 as much as possible for your collaborative research infrastructure because it comes for free through the UO. There are other tools out in the world that you can use for program management, data management, etc., but Microsoft 365 is what we will be using as must as possible. This will also be a benefit to you because Microsoft apps are used regularly by business, non-profit, government, and education industries. 

 

All required tools and platforms are available for free through the university or open source and work on both Mac and PC computers either as web or desktop apps.

Please be aware that some of these apps require installation on your computer. You might need to make space for them to be installed and run on it.

Links to how-to documentation and where to download the apps are available on Canvas.
- Publishing: GitHub, CollectionBuilder
- Storage: SharePoint, GitHub
- Writing and Coding: Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Word, DMP (Data Management Plan) Tool
- Cataloging: Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets
