# Course Title
Humanities Research Data Management

# Course Number
DSCI 350 / LIB 350

# Course Description
This course provides students with theoretical and practical experience in collecting, processing, archiving, and publishing humanities data (images, video, sound, text, maps, etc.) gathered from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. With the goal of building thematic digital collections as researchers, students will learn digital methodologies focusing on the technical, legal, ethical, and social aspects of working with humanities research data throughout its curation lifecycle. This includes hands-on experience finding, assessing, organizing, and reformatting data; creating and remediating descriptive metadata; evaluating and determining copyright and licensing; writing a data management plan using the standards set by the National Endowment for the Humanities; and sharing thematic research digital collections using GitHub and the open-source platform CollectionBuilder.

# Course Learning Outcomes
- Formal introduction to digital stewardship methodologies (digital curation and digital preservation)
- Fluency in collecting, standardizing, and structuring archival materials to be used as research data
- Designing and implementing a humanities-based research data management plan
- Experience working as a team and developing communication skills related to a on a technology project
- Using technology platforms, GitHub and CollectionBuilder, that make digital collections publicly available online

# Acquired Skills
- Ability to create and follow a digital collections data management plan
- Ability to apply information professional best practices and standards to digital files and metadata for digital collections curation and preservation
- Ability to structure metadata using spreadsheets and making them interoperable
- Ability to evaluate historical materials and other resources using best judgements about United States copyright, fair use, and Creative Commons
- Ability to find and select research materials to reuse within a thematic digital collection
- Ability to publish a website using GitHub Pages and the Jekyll theme, CollectionBuilder

# Estimate Student Workload
This course has students working in groups to complete a term-long project. All requirements for this group project are scaffolded throughout the 10-week course. This means that all lab activities and assignments are designed bring you to publishing a thematic research digital collection using GitHub and CollectionBuilder, an open-source Jekyll static site generator specifically designed to present digital collections and digital exhibits online.

[More information about the final project and graded assignments can be found on the Term-Project page](/content/termproject.html).

*Each student will:*  

- Read assigned required readings identified in the syllabus. This includes book chapters, journal articles, technology tutorials, and audio-visual materials. All required readings are available on Canvas or through the UO Libraries in print or electronic format.

- Attend all lectures and labs, and participate in in-class activities because they support developing your term-based group project.

- Submit all individual assignments: Mid-term self-evaluation and reflection; Mid-term group evaluation and reflection; Final self-evaluation and reflection; Final group-evaluation and reflection  

- Submit group assignments: Mid-term project progress report; Data management plan and data documentation and dataset; Final project presentation
