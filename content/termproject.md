### Purpose


#### What are you going to make?
Throughout the term, you will be working with a small group to gather, document, build, and publish a research digital collection that is thematically related to the State of Oregon. You are welcome to pick a topic of interest to students of history, cultural studies, science, education, political science, etc. Here is an example: [Environmental Justice Research Repository: Interconnected histories of racism, urban ecology, and environmental activism in Eugene, Oregon](https://learn-static.github.io/eng-470/)

You are **required** to use objects that come from special collections and archives, museums, galleries, and libraries. We’re specifically looking to only use primary sources.

Think of your collection being data that will be used by researchers, GLAM professionals, and data experts interested in observing and interpreting history to learn something new or make connections to the present day. Many people could want to use your collection to create timelines, digital narrative maps, eBooks, book companion websites, digital exhibits, and more. Before those people can use your collection as data, all historic objects need digital curation and preservation actions applied to them. Something to note, digital curation and preservation actions can also be referred to as data curation and preservation.

These actions include gathering objects based on a topic and given context; standardizing and remediating data according to information professional best practices and guidelines; objects copyright and licensing evaluated for reuse; structuring data for computer interoperability; reviewing data for quality and security and privacy; backing-up and archiving data to prevent loss; and publishing objects contextualized and described for public access. Most importantly all actions decisions need documentation. This is because for people to reuse your collection as data, they need to know why objects were brought together and formed and intellectually described and arranged as a digital collection.

This term-project is one that is scaffolded across 10 weeks. There are 4 aspects to the project that you will be graded on as a group. While curating your collection, your term-based group project will cumulate through required assignments. 

They include:
1.	Project Progress Report
2.	Final group presentation
3.	Data management plan and data documentation
4.	Thematic research digital collection made publicly available with CollectionBuilder and GitHub

Additionally, all group members will be required to submit self and group evaluations and reflections during the middle and end of the term. This is meant to be a way to assess yourself and peers and allow your instructor to give you and your group feedback that improves your work.

### White are you completing this project? 
This project is designed to provide all students with practical skills for curating and preserving research data when developing a thematic research digital collection. By completing this project, you will become experienced working with data as a humanist who does research using GLAMs. This group project is also meant to teach you about the methods and techniques that are required while building data-driven websites while using primary sources. This includes becoming well versed in operating cloud storage technologies, telecommunication apps, cataloging using metadata standards, remediating data entry, making judgement calls around United States copyright law, editing documents, audio, and visual resources, using open-source technologies, and archiving research data.

### Why is this project relevant to your success after college?
Your project models real life experiences building digital collections as if you were curating and publishing as a data-driven information professional.  In fact, the steps and processes learned through this project are ones that you can find regularly at non-profit organizations, cultural heritage organizations, educational institutions, and at technology companies.
So, if you someday hope to become a cultural heritage memory worker or see yourself working with digital media in any industry then you’re going to be prepared for a job that requires data organizing, sorting, describing, analyzing, documenting, archiving, and publishing. These professional job types include, but are not limited to:

- Data Analysts
- Data Coordinators or Managers
- Digital Assets Managers or Digital Content Managers
- Digital Archivists or Librarians
- Museum Curators
- Researchers

### Skills
This project will allow you to practice the following skills:
- Publish a digital collection using GitHub and CollectionBuilder
- Write a data management plan using United States federal government requirements
- Create documentation describing how data is and needs to be organized, described, and shared for reproducibility and reuse
- Setup and work within a collaborative research infrastructure for a team of people who have different roles and responsibilities
- Use cloud storage, project management, word processing documents, media production, and spreadsheets
- Apply library, archives, and museum metadata and file format best practices and guidelines
- Select and evaluate cultural heritage resources from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums
- Evaluate cultural heritage objects for reuse in accordance with United States copyright law
- Present and write about thematic research digital collections

### Knowledge
Additionally, this term-based project will help you:

- Understand the principles of digital stewardship, digital curation, and digital preservation
- Understand the architecture of humanities-based research data, e.g. digital files, metadata
- Know why standardizing data collection is important for research analysis and publishing
- Realize why libraries, museums, and archives create standards for collecting, archiving, and publishing digital collections online
- Be conversant in sensitive and culturally informed ethical curation
- Know how to publish an open research dataset if one were to do so with the United States federal g overnment
- Understand and interpret the foundations of United States copyright law

<br/>

### Task/Prompt
#### What do you need to do? 

To complete this project successfully, you should:
- Setup a collaborative digital research infrastructure using cloud-based and desktop apps, e.g., SharePoint, MS Teams, SharePoint Documents Library, Microsoft Office, GitHub, CollectionBuilder (Jekyll)
    - We’re using Microsoft products because you get access to them for free through UO’s Microsoft 365 subscription.
    - Select a theme related to the State of Oregon. Pick a topic of interest to students of history, cultural studies, science, education, political science, etc. 
- Select 20-30 archival objects that are publicly available and online through GLAMs. Object selections should be relevant to your topic. Consider picking a range of object types, including text, images, sound, oral history, and moving images.
    - *Note: All objects must be in the public domain, have a Rights Statement for non-commercial or educational use, or have a Creative Commons license. If you have objects that fall outside of these permissions, then you must speak with your instructor. These objects need their reproduction rights reviewed before publishing.*
- Create a data management plan and documentation for your digital collection
    - Readme file about your project including information about the technology platform (CollectionBuilder), how it is hosted (GitHub), and your group’s assigned roles and responsibilities
    - Describe folder/dictionary organization
    - Metadata application profile
    - A spreadsheet with all objects cataloged following metadata application profile requirements
    - Content inventory of all technical information about digital files compliant with digital preservation standards, e.g., quantity, volume, and technical state of your digital collection
    - Data management plan that follows NEH requirements (found via the DMP Tool).
    - Follow digital preservation friendly file formats
    - Create and catalog objects using the class metadata application profile’s data standard and resource description requirements.
    - Use CollectionBuilder and GitHub to publish your digital collection, data management plan, and data documentation



#### How do you need to do it?
All group members will be assigned a designated project role based on their interests and strengths. Everyone is expected to contribute and do their part. 

Groups will have plenty of opportunities to meet during class but need to make time to get together outside of it. Staying on top of deadlines and keeping up with lectures and labs is key. Please make sure to establish communication norms for your group. This includes setting a regular scheduled weekly time to meet outside of class and making sure your research infrastructure includes communication channels like online chat, Zoom, e-mail, or other modalities that work for your team to stay in contact and on task with each other.

### Criteria for Success
#### How do you know that you are on the right track to success? How will you know what you are doing is what is expected of you?

This project is structured with your success in mind. Rather than one big deliverable at the end, the project is structured with assignment milestones and in-class learning activities to keep you on track. This includes your group receiving continuous feedback. See the Project Breakdown and Due Dates section and review the week-by-week course content for these details. It is asked that as you move through the term, please keep in touch with your instructor early and often if there are concerns about your ability to complete the project successfully.

**A note about data management plans**

Not all data management plans are going to be structured the same way because disciplines are different. However, at the core, they all aim to meet the same goals, make decisions related to curation and preservation. We will be using the National Endowment for Humanities data management, which requires you to answer curation questions related to a humanities research project. You also have access to data management plans created by the University of Oregon Libraries designed by professional digital curators. Examples will be provided during class and will be available on Canvas. You are also welcome to review examples found publicly via the Data Management Plan (DMP) Tool.

#### Rubrics
All rubrics will be shared on Canvas and in-class when assignments are introduced.

*Project Progress Report*
Begin writing a data management plan using the knowledge you’ve acquired between Week 1 – 5. Don’t worry if you can’t answer all the questions. Try doing so using the NEH DMP (using the DMP tool) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council Data Management Plan Rubric.  Details for what to include and how you will be graded can be found on Canvas.

*Final Presentation*
During Week 10 all groups are required to present their digital collection, CollectionBuilder website, how they worked as a group, and how they managed their data. These presentations must be 20-minutes long, not including Q&A. Q&A should be ~10 minutes long. Details for what to include and how you will be graded can be found on Canvas.

*Group and Self-Evaluations*
You are individually required to write group and self-evaluations and reflections. You will be provided with a template to use and questions to reflect upon. Details for what to include and how you will be graded can be found on Canvas.

*Data Management Plan and Data Documentation*
Your work will be evaluated using the “Arts and Humanities Research Council Data Management Plan Rubric” and following the National Endowment for the Humanities DMP requirements: [NEH’s Data Management Plan Requirements](https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/Data%20Management%20Plans%2C%202019.pdf). What you’ve been learning throughout the 10 weeks is expected to be reflected in your final work.

| Performance Criteria | | Detailed | | Addresses but incomplete/unsatisfactory | | Not addressed |
| ---------- | | ---------- | | ---------- | | ---------- |
| 1. Summary of digital outputs and technologies | | Plan provides a clear description of the digital output or digital technology and the type of access envisaged e.g. ‘freely available online’. The summary explains how this will be achieved technically so reviewers can assess whether plans are appropriate. | | There’s a partial description, for example an explanation of the data but not the access plans, or too little information given the scale and importance of the digital output. There is insufficient information to assess whether the overall plans are sound. | | It is unclear what will be created or how. The proposal indicates that significant digital outputs will be created but the technical plan doesn’t match this. |
| | | | | | | |
| 2a. Standards and formats | | Relevant statistics are provided to explain the size, quantity and duration of the data.  An explanation is given about which formats and standards will be used and why. This demonstrates an understanding about which formats are appropriate to each purpose e.g. to provide access or to archive data. | | A data volume is stated, but it’s difficult to interpret how many files that pertains to or how large and complex the dataset is. Formats and standards are named but it is not clear that these are understood and that choices have been made for valid reasons. | | The description misses important information and doesn’t give a clear sense of sounds decisions regarding the technical methodology. |
| | | | | | | |
| 2b. Hardware and software | | It is clear what (if any) additional hardware and software will be required. The additional kit is clearly necessary and aligns with statements in the justification of resources. If nothing is required, the plan should clearly state this is not applicable. | | The suggested resources seem unconvincing (e.g. items that should already be provided by the institution or software that doesn’t seem necessary for the proposed digital output). | | The plan does not state that this section is not applicable. |
| | | | | | | |
| 2c. Technical methodology | | There is a full description of the development process from data capture to delivery of a digital resource. Key issues such as quality control and backup are covered for all the research environments / circumstances e.g. in-house procedures and fieldwork. There is a clear timetable for technical delivery that relates to the overall project milestones in the case for support. | | Certain information is missing e.g. how quality will be checked if a number of assistants are transcribing and documenting resources. Backup is not explained for all circumstances in which data will be collected or stored. A timetable is missing, so it is unclear how the technical work aligns with the research activity. | | There is no clear technical methodology or plan for how the data will be acquired, processed and used. |
| | | | | | | |
| 3.Technical support and expertise | | The plan explains what skills are needed and demonstrates that the team has access to these, identifying key individuals.  It is clear that advice has been sought, potentially drawing in external partners from outside the institution, where needed. The quality and robustness of the technical plan as a whole reassures the reviewer about access to technical support and expertise. | | Some information is provided but not enough, for example the role of system developer may be clearly identified and resourced but the responsibilities for creating and managing the data are blurred across partners. The project may seem over-reliant on one key member of staff and the associated case for support doesn’t deal with the risks of losing them. | | The plan fails to provide details and says these issues will be addressed by technical partners during the project. |
| | | | | | | |
| 4a. Data preservation | | A clear statement is given about which digital outputs will be preserved, where and for how long. | | Some information is provided but not enough, for example the role of the repository manager may be clearly identified and resourced but the responsibilities for creating and managing the data are blurred across partners. The project may seem over-reliant on one key member of staff and the associated case for support doesn’t deal with the risks of losing them. | | The plan fails to provide details and says these issues will be addressed by technical partners during the project. |
| | | | | | | |
| 4b. Access and sustainability | | There is a clear plan to ensure the digital outputs remain publicly accessible and usable for at least 3 years beyond the end of funding. Sound justifications are provided if access to the outputs is not to be sustained or if open public access is not envisaged. The reviewer is convinced by the institutional commitment or other resource plans to ensure the costs of sustainability can be covered. | | The sustainability plans fail to address one or more of the five key elements – what is to be sustained, where, how, for how long, or how the costs will be covered. The plans are not well-justified, for example access may be restricted to ‘bone fide medieval historians’ with no sound reason. More information is needed to be convinced that access will be sustained. | | The plan does not state that the digital outputs will be made available (ideally with open public access). |
